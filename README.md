Anomaly detection

This first data set captures traders' performance but we would like to see the most abnormal traders.  Would you be able to identify 1% of these traders whom we would like to conduct interviews and discuss their style?  Style here merely refers to the field names in the data set.

I adopt Isolation Forest as algorithm for anomaly detection. 
Also, i dig deeper by analyzing anomalous trader to understand their patern..
